  /**
   * Gets the selector.
   *
   * JSON object describing criteria used to select documents. The selector specifies fields in the document, and
   * provides an expression to evaluate with the field content or other data.
   *
   * The selector object must:
   *   * Be structured as valid JSON.
   *   * Contain a valid query expression.
   *
   * Using a selector is significantly more efficient than using a JavaScript filter function, and is the recommended
   * option if filtering on document attributes only.
   *
   * Elementary selector syntax requires you to specify one or more fields, and the corresponding values required for
   * those fields. You can create more complex selector expressions by combining operators.
   *
   * Operators are identified by the use of a dollar sign `$` prefix in the name field.
   *
   * There are two core types of operators in the selector syntax:
   * * Combination operators: applied at the topmost level of selection. They are used to combine selectors. A
   * combination operator takes a single argument. The argument is either another selector, or an array of selectors.
   * * Condition operators: are specific to a field, and are used to evaluate the value stored in that field. For
   * instance, the basic `$eq` operator matches when the specified field contains a value that is equal to the supplied
   * argument.
   *
   * It is important for query performance to use appropriate selectors:
   * * Only equality operators such as `$eq`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, and `$lte` (but not `$ne`) can be used as the basis
   * of a query. You should include at least one of these in a selector.
   * * Some operators such as `$not`, `$or`, `$in`, and `$regex` cannot be answered from an index. For query selectors
   * use these operators in conjunction with equality operators or create and use a partial index to reduce the number
   * of documents that will need to be scanned.
   *
   * See [the Cloudant Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-operators)for a list of all available
   * combination and conditional operators.
   *
   * For further reference see [selector syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-selector-syntax).
